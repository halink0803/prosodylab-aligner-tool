Fossil fuels are non-renewable energy sources. They include oil, coal, and natural gas. They can be used to create energy, generate electricity, or drive big machinery. Unfortunately, they are harmful to the environment. Viet Nam still relies mostly on non-renewable energy sources, however, hydro power is increasingly used here too. Hydro and nuclear power can generate a great deal of energy. They are renewable and plentiful. However, hydro power is limited because dams cannot be built in certain areas. Nuclear power can provide enough electricity for the world’s needs, but it is dangerous. The sun and the wind are other alternative sources of energy. The wind turns turbines to make electricity. Solar power can be converted into electricity. It can be used to heat or cool our houses. Although there are some disadvantages, these alternative energy sources can of er abundant amounts of clean, safe electricity.
