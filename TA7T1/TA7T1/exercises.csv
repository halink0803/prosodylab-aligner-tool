According to U.S. government statistics, about one-fifth of the American population does volunteer work each year. Americans have had the tradition of volunteering and helping one another since the early days of the country. Americans volunteer not because they are forced or paid to do it. They enjoy it! Traditional volunteer activities include raising money for people in need, cooking and giving food, doing general labour (such as clean-up projects and home repair), providing transportation (such as giving rides to the elderly), and tutoring/mentoring young people.
